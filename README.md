# User Management Application

This project is a web application I wrote to improve myself. Using Spring MVC, MySQL, JDBC, Thymeleaf, HTML and Bootstrap technologies, I developed an application that performs user login, logout and session control, performs user add, delete, update and listing operations, and has note add, delete and listing pages. Data, cookies and sessions encrypted and secured with google-tink.
